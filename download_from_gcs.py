"""Download the reference/prior-quarter files build_odoo_report.py and
build_master_report.py need, into this directory, before running them.

The prior-quarter list is computed from the calendar date (see
quarter_files.py) rather than hardcoded, so nothing here needs editing when
a new quarter starts - the current quarter itself is excluded, since
build_odoo_report.py builds that one fresh in the same run.
